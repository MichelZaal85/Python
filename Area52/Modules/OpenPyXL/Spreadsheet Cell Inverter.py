You can write this program by using nested for loops to read in the spreadsheetâ€™s data 
into a list of lists data structure. This data structure could have sheetData[x][y] for 
the cell at column x and row y. Then, when writing out the new spreadsheet, use 
sheetData[y][x] for the cell at column x and row y.
